# KellyPublicStuff

This repository contains a collection of my personal scripts and small utilities that I’ve chosen to share publicly.  
They’re available for others to view, learn from, or adapt ideas from — not for collaboration or modification.

All content is provided as-is.  
Please **do not submit edits or pull requests**. If something here is useful to you, feel free to copy or fork it.
