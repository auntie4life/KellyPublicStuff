# KellyPublicStuff

This repository contains a selection of my personal scripts and small utilities that I’ve decided to share publicly.  
They’re here so others can reference, learn from, or adapt ideas for their own use.

All files are made available as-is — please do not submit edits or pull requests.  
If you’d like to use any of the code, feel free to copy it directly or fork your own version.
